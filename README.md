Implementation in ActionScript of a prototype Cortical Learning Algorithm region. See Numenta.org for more info.

The current iteration uses the mouse X position as the input data stream, and uses the 28/128 bit fixed width sliding bucket as per Numenta's standard scalar encoder. You can see the encoded bitmask at the top of the screen.

All the settings can be adjusted in cla.Region
